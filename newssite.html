            <h2>Rumour: PS6 Could Span a Console and Handheld Device</h2>
            <h3><small>Ngày xuất bản: 22/09/2024</small></h3>
            <p>
                It seems like we’re slowly reaching that point in the generation where PS6 speculation starts to pick up pace. Earlier this week a report from Reuters revealed Sony had explored a potential relationship with Intel to manufacture the chip for its next-gen console, but ultimately opted for AMD once again – with backwards compatibility being massively important to the manufacturer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now well-regarded tech leaker KeplerL2 has taken to the NeoGAF forums to report that two SoCs (or system-on-a-chips) are allegedly in-development for PlayStation’s next console. In a post, the snoopster said: “I don’t know if it’s an Xbox Series X|S situation or a home console and handheld.” It’s speculated that Microsoft is also planning console and handheld options for its future hardware.
            </p>

            <p>
                We’ve been unable to verify the claims here, so they remain very much a rumour. It’s also worth noting that, while two chips may be being explored at the moment, there’s no guarantee they’ll both become commercial products by the time the PS6 launches in around 2027 or 2028.

            <h2>New Galaxy S25 Ultra Exclusive Teases Samsung’s Ambitious Plans</h2>
            <h3><small>Ngày xuất bản: 22/09/2024</small></h3>

            <p>
                With an expected launch in January 2025, Samsung’s Galaxy S family will again set the smartphone tone for the first half of the year. It looks like Samsung is preparing a significant update for the S25 family in general and the Galaxy S25 Ultra in particular.
            </p>

            <p>
                Why else would you give it the internal codename of “paradigm”?
            </p>

            <p>
                These details on the Galaxy S25 Ultra come from the well-connected GalaxyClub team in The Netherlands. They also highlight that the latest design leaks do show a tweaked approach to the handset, moving towards a more angular and boxlike design by buffing out the curved edges.
            </p>

            <p>
                While full details on the main camera for the Galaxy S25 Ultra are not fully known, it’s possible to draw out some clues from the latest peripheral to leak. Noted commentator IceUniverse has picked up an S25 Ultra case, and the gaps for the lenses and sensors tell their own story.
            </p>

            <p>
                The paradigm shift looks unlikely to change the design around the four primary lenses; the case keeps the same rough dimensions for the camera lenses. Alongside these cutouts are gaps for the laser rangefinder used for autofocus and the LED flash (which doubles as the built-in torch).

            <h2>OnePlus 13 leak reveals how it could blow away iPhone 16</h2>
            <h3><small>Ngày xuất bản: 21/09/2024</small></h3>
            <p>
                The OnePlus 13 is expected to launch next month (well, in China, at least), and while there's no word yet on a global rollout, the flagship is already shaping up to rank among the best Android phones. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Rumors about the OnePlus 13 so far suggest it'll get some top-notch specs, and the most recent from reputable Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station, courtesy of GSM Arena, claims the OnePlus 13 will get an option for 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM. That matches the maximum amount its predecessor, the OnePlus 12, was capable of, and outclasses the iPhone 16 series three times over. Both the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models launched this month with 8GB of RAM, an upgrade from 6GB of RAM on the iPhone 15 for the standard models.
            </p>

            <p>
                That means the OnePlus 13 "is the only 24GB LPDDR5X" of the next wave of flagship smartphones, DCS said in a post on Weibo. The post added that the amount of memory will remain consistent "for the whole series," though it's not clear if that will extend to the lower-price OnePlus 13R. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Now here comes the bad news. Of course, that high amount of memory is likely going to come with an equally impressive price tag. The cost of the One Plus 13 with a maxed-out configuration (24GB RAM and 1TB of storage) "will be higher this time" than the OnePlus 12 with all the trimmings, DCS said. The post didn't give a ballpark estimate of the price, so it remains up in the air how much that price hike could be. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As for the rest of its rumored specs, the OnePlus 13 is expected to have a 6,000 mAh battery with support for 100W wired and 50W wireless charging, an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, and an improved water resistance rating. It's tipped to feature a revamped 6.8-inch 1440x3168 with a micro quad-curved display on all sides, a departure from the bi-curved display found on the OnePlus 12. We also expect the OnePlus 13 to use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip considering OnePlus has used the latest Qualcomm chip in each phone.
